# Purpose

This project is designed to help someone learn how to properly use git. This
project will have a basic website and allow a user to adjust features of the
website and fix possible bus or documentation if they so desire. 

This is for my ENGL4092 Tech/Sci Writing course Summer 2018.

# Features

There is file called index.html, this file contains the code for the website
and has a simple program of mindlessly clicking a button and a count of
button clicks.
